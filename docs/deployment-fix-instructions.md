# CodedSwitch Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Render is looking for package.json in `/opt/render/project/src/package.json` but it should be in the root directory.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Check Repository Structure
1. Go to: https://github.com/asume21/Final-draft-website
2. Verify that `package.json` is visible in the root directory (not inside any folders)
3. If files are nested in a folder, this is the problem

### Option 2: Manual Render Configuration
1. In Render dashboard, go to your service settings
2. Set "Root Directory" to the correct path where package.json exists
3. Or set it to empty/blank if package.json is in root

### Option 3: Re-upload Project Structure
If files were uploaded incorrectly nested:
1. Download the `codeswitch-complete.tar.gz` from Replit again
2. Extract it locally to verify structure
3. Upload individual files to GitHub root directory

## Correct Structure Should Be:
```
Final-draft-website/
├── package.json (ROOT LEVEL)
├── client/
├── server/
├── shared/
├── README.md
└── other files...
```

## Not This:
```
Final-draft-website/
└── some-folder/
    ├── package.json (NESTED - WRONG)
    ├── client/
    └── server/
```
