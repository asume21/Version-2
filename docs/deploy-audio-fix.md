# Audio Fix Deployment Guide

## Files that need to be updated in your GitHub repo:

### 1. server/routes.ts
- Fixed AI provider availability check for both XAI_API_KEY and GROK_API_KEY
- Added debug logging for deployment

### 2. server/grok.ts  
- Updated to use XAI_API_KEY environment variable
- Ensures Grok integration works properly

### 3. client/src/lib/audio.ts
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Replaced missing audio files with synthesized drums
- Created proper kick, snare, and hi-hat using Tone.js synthesizers
- Fixed beat pattern sequencing logic
- Added proper audio context initialization

### 4. client/src/pages/beat-studio.tsx
- Improved error handling for audio playback
- Added user interaction audio initialization
- Fixed TypeScript type issues

## Quick Deploy Steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repo: https://github.com/asume21/Final-draft-website/tree/main/GitBridge%20(1)/GitBridge

2. Edit these 4 files and replace their content with the updated versions from this Replit

3. On Render dashboard:
   - Change environment variable from `GROK_API_KEY` to `XAI_API_KEY` 
   - Keep the same API key value
   - Redeploy

4. Test the Beat Studio - you should now hear actual drum sounds!

## What was fixed:
- Audio system was trying to load `/sounds/kick.wav` files that didn't exist
- Now uses synthesized drums that work in any browser
- Proper beat pattern mapping from AI-generated patterns to drum sounds
- Grok will appear in all AI provider dropdowns as default
